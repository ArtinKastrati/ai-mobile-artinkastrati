# Services Directory

Place your service modules here (API calls, AI integrations, utilities).

## Example Structure:
- `api.js` - API service for backend communication
- `ai.js` - AI/ML service integration
- `storage.js` - Local storage utilities
- `auth.js` - Authentication service
- etc.

## Best Practices:
- Separate concerns (one service per responsibility)
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Export service functions as named exports
