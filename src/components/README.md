# Components Directory

Place your reusable React Native components here.

## Example Structure:
- `Button.js` - Custom button component
- `Header.js` - App header component
- `Card.js` - Card component
- etc.

## Best Practices:

- Use meaningful names
- Export components as default or named exports
